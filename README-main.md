# Professional READme Generator
Module 9 Challenge

## Description

My inspiration for this project was to create a README.md file generator using a command-line application.  This command-line app allows users to quickly and easily generate a professional README.md file using Node.js and the Inquirer package.  

## Installation

User needs to install inquirer, use npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage

Open command-line application and use the following command: node index.js
The command-line application will accept user input and will be prompted for information about their project. Once completed, a README.md file will be created and will display the information provided.
